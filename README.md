# Hands-On Data Modeling

This repository explores database design through real-world case studies.  
The goal is to practice translating business requirements into Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and database schemas.  

---

## What You’ll Find
- Case studies with business scenarios (e.g., hospital system)  
- Business rules written from a client perspective  
- ERD models using crow’s foot notation  
- Notes on how requirements translate into schema design  

---

## Example Case: Hospital/Clinic System
The hospital system case models how to manage:
- Patients and their addresses  
- Patient visits  
- Doctors attending visits  
- Symptoms reported during visits  
- Tracking patients who have left the hospital  

It includes business rules, relationship cardinalities, and an analyst narrative.  
Details are available in: [hospital-system/README.md](hospital-system/README.md)

## Why This Repo
Data modeling is best learned by doing.  
Each scenario begins with business rules and ends with a technical ERD.  
This helps:  
- Analysts practice converting requirements into models;  
- Database designers justify schema choices.
